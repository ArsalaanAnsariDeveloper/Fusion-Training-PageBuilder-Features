# fusion-10

## User story
As a user, I would like to be able to add an article body feature to my page.

## Concepts
- Core Components

## New files:
- `/components/features/article/default.jsx`

## Changed files
- `package.json`

## What's next
So far, everything we've worked on assumes we're building out a single site. If you are developing for multiple sites, however, we'll need to introduce some additional concepts. Switch to branch `fusion-11` to learn more about how to start implementing "multi-site" functionality in your repo.
