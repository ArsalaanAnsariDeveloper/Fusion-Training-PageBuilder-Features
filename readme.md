# fusion-12

## User story
As a user, I would like to configure my site to render different content for different outputs such as Google AMP.

## Concepts
- Working with multiple output types

## New files:
- `/components/output-types/amp.jsx`
- `/components/features/global/card/amp.jsx`

## What's next
Just like that, our site now supports AMP! There's just one more step left in training: Adding styles to the site. Switch to branch `fusion-13` to see one Arc-recommended example of how to implement styles.
