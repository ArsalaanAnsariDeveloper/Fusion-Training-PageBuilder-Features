## What's next?
One of the many features of PageBuilder is the ability to allow non-technical users to customize the appearance or functionality of their pages without requiring a developer. In the next step, we'll learn how we, as developers, can make such functionality available in the PageBuilder UI based on a set of options. Switch to branch `fusion-07` to see the completed code for this next step.
