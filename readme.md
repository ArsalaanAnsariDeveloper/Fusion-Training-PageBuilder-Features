# fusion-07

On this branch, we have updated our `/global/card` feature to offer PageBuilder users the ability to customize the feature using Custom Fields.

## User story
As a user, I would like to customize the appearance or functionality of my feature in the PageBuilder UI based on a set of options.

## Concepts
- Custom Fields

## New Files on this branch
- None

## Changed files:
- `/components/features/global/card/default.jsx`

## What's next?
So far, our feature has only been able to render content from a single source: the `@Consumer`, which provides the page's global content to the feature. In our next task, we'll learn how to fetch content dynamically, both server-side and client-side. Switch to branch `fusion-08` to learn more about this next step.
