# fusion-09

## User story
As a user, I would like to group features together to create more complex layouts.

## Concepts
- Chains
- Multiple features

## New files:
- `/components/chains/default.jsx`
- `/components/chains/double-chain.jsx`

## What's next
This branch gives us the major components for creating a manually curated page (albeit a simple one) within PageBuilder. But what about rendering a full article? Switch to branch `fusion-10` to see one way to prototype an article body feature in just a few commands.
