# fusion-11

## User story
As a user, I would like configure my pages to use site-specific variables.

## Concepts
- Runtime Properties

## New files:
- `/properties/index.js`
- `/properties/sites/demo.js`

## What's next
Our next task is to consider how we can use PageBuilder to render content for different outputs that require special formats. Switch to branch `fusion-12` to learn more about working with multiple output types.
