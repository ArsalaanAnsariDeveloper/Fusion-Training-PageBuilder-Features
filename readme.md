# fusion-05

On this branch, we have updated our `/global/card` feature to render content from a content source.

## User story
As a user, I would like be able to pipe content into my feature so that it renders information from the API.

## Concepts
- Content sources
- `@Consumer`

## New Files on this branch
- `/content/sources/content-api.js`
- `.env`

## Changed files:
- `/components/features/global/card/default.jsx`

## What's next?
Now that we've updated our feature and created a content source, it's time to render this via PageBuilder. Switch to branch `fusion-06` to learn more about this next step.
